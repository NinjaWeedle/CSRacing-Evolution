Calculator Street Racing II: Evolution DEVELOPER'S DOCUMENTATION

STRINGS USED:
Str1: Car name
Str2: Opponent name
Str3: Car to buy name
Str0: temporary string (often used to create grey "bands")

Car save format:
A car's tune setup is all saved in its list entry in |LCSE, much like CSRacing I. However, more data is stored there than in CSRacing I:

111.14
The numbers after the decimal is the car's paint color.
the first whole number is the Car's engine tune. (1 = default)
the tens digit is the Weight tune settings (1 = default)
the hundreds digit is the tires you currently have equipped. (1 = default[a.k.a Street Tires], 2 = Sports Tires, 3 = Race tires, 4 = Drag Slicks)
